Phase 5.2 — Signal Computation Specification (v1)

Status: LOCKED once approved
Scope: Cogniflow v1 only
Authority: If implementation conflicts with this document, this document wins.

⸻

1. Purpose

This document defines the exact, technical meaning of Cogniflow v1 signals.

It exists to:
	•	Prevent semantic drift
	•	Enforce non-evaluative language
	•	Provide an implementation contract for engineering
	•	Serve as the reference for validation and future evolution

This document is intentionally narrow. It does not define UI, pedagogy, or long-term interpretation.

⸻

2. Scope Boundaries (Strict)

Included
	•	Single-session signals only
	•	Deterministic computation
	•	Backend, read-only derivation
	•	Human-readable descriptions derived mechanically from data

Explicitly Excluded
	•	Cross-session aggregation
	•	Cross-user comparison
	•	Scores or rankings
	•	Advice or prescriptions
	•	Trait attribution
	•	ML or probabilistic inference

⸻

3. Data Sources (v1)

Signals may only be computed from the following tables:
	•	sessions
	•	run_events
	•	error_events

No other data sources are permitted in v1.

⸻

4. General Signal Rules

All v1 signals MUST satisfy all of the following:
	1.	Session-local
Signals describe only what occurred within a single session.
	2.	Descriptive, not evaluative
Allowed verbs: occurred, was executed, happened.
Forbidden verbs: struggled, succeeded, improved, persisted.
	3.	Mechanically derivable
A signal must be computable by explicit logic, without interpretation of intent.
	4.	Omissible
If required data is missing, the signal is omitted rather than inferred.
	5.	Exact wording
Signal descriptions must match the wording specified in this document exactly.

⸻

5. Signal Categories (v1)

v1 defines exactly three categories:
	•	Category A — Execution Activity
	•	Category B — Errors
	•	Category C — Time

No additional categories are allowed in v1.

⸻

6. Category A — Execution Activity

Signal A1 — Run Count

Key: run_count

Raw Data:
	•	run_events filtered by session_id

Computation:
	•	Count of all run events in the session

Value Type:
	•	Integer

Description Rules:
	•	If run_count == 1:
“You ran your code once during this session.”
	•	If run_count > 1:
“You ran your code multiple times during this session.”

Forbidden:
	•	Numeric counts in description
	•	Any implication of efficiency or repetition quality

⸻

Signal A2 — Repeated Execution Presence

Key: repeated_execution

Raw Data:
	•	Derived from run_count

Computation:
	•	run_count > 1

Value Type:
	•	Boolean

Description (only if true):

“The code was executed more than once during this session.”

Forbidden:
	•	References to revision, iteration strategy, or improvement

⸻

7. Category B — Errors

Signal B1 — Error Presence

Key: errors_present

Raw Data:
	•	error_events joined to run_events by run_id

Computation:
	•	True if at least one error event exists for the session

Value Type:
	•	Boolean

Description (only if true):

“Errors occurred during this session.”

Forbidden:
	•	Error counts in description
	•	Language implying mistake, struggle, or fault

⸻

Signal B2 — Error Followed by Run

Key: error_followed_by_run

Raw Data:
	•	error_events.occurred_at
	•	run_events.executed_at

Computation:
	•	True if any run event occurred after the first error event

Value Type:
	•	Boolean

Description (only if true):

“After an error occurred, the code was run again.”

Forbidden:
	•	Words like persistence, recovery, resilience

⸻

8. Category C — Time

Signal C1 — Session Duration

Key: session_duration_minutes

Raw Data:
	•	sessions.started_at
	•	sessions.ended_at

Computation:
	•	ended_at − started_at, rounded to whole minutes

Value Type:
	•	Integer (minutes)

Description (only if ended_at exists):

“This session lasted X minutes.”

Forbidden:
	•	Qualitative descriptors (long, short, quick, slow)

⸻

Signal C2 — Time Before First Run

Key: time_to_first_run_minutes

Raw Data:
	•	sessions.started_at
	•	earliest run_events.executed_at

Computation:
	•	first_run − started_at, rounded to whole minutes

Value Type:
	•	Integer (minutes)

Description (only if at least one run exists):

“The first code execution occurred after X minutes.”

Forbidden:
	•	Seconds-level precision
	•	Interpretation of planning or hesitation

⸻

9. Response Structure (v1)

Signals are returned as a list. Order has no semantic meaning.

Example:

{
  "session_id": 42,
  "signals": [
    {
      "key": "run_count",
      "value": 5,
      "description": "You ran your code multiple times during this session."
    }
  ]
}


⸻

10. Explicit Deferrals

The following are not permitted in v1 and are deferred to later versions:

v2 Candidates
	•	Cross-session aggregation
	•	Per-user baselines
	•	Error categorization
	•	Strategy change heuristics

v3 Candidates
	•	ML-based interpretation
	•	Longitudinal trajectories
	•	Institutional aggregation

⸻

11. Invariant Rule

No signal may be added, removed, or reworded without:
	1.	Updating this document
	2.	Explicitly justifying the change

⸻

12. Final Note

Cogniflow v1 signals are mirrors, not measurements.

They exist to make activity visible — not to define ability, quality, or merit.

This document enforces that boundary.
